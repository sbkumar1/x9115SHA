#Evaluation of Models DTLZ1,DTLZ3,DTLZ5 and DTLZ7 using Genetic Algorithm

###Submitted By - Shashank Bipin Kumar (sbkumar) for ASE Fall 2015 Code 9

##I. Overview
This project would be about evaluating models DTLZ1,DTLZ3,DTLZ5 and DTLZ7 using   

##II. Background
####Genetic Algorithm


##III. Introduction


##IV. Implementation


##V. Results



## Threats to Validity


##Future Work
1. The experiment was run on only one model, running the experiment on multiple models would help us achieve better conclusive results in terms of ranking the models.  
2. Better comparison techniques than binary domination can be used compare between models.  
3. Different values of mutation and crossover can be tried to see if the result of an algorithm improves.  
4. Experiment can be run for more number of iterations.  
5. Runtime and Optimality are two important criterion when selecting an algorithm in real world for a particular model. We can try to find out runtime  for each of these algorithms.  

## Running Instructions
1. On a ubuntu 14.04 machine please copy all the code in home directory.
2. Please give executable permission to "run.py".
3. Run the file using command "python run.py".
