#Comparison  of Simulated Annealing, MaxWalkSat and Differential Evolution Using Less Than Operators

##Overview
Engineering is search of optimal solution. The search of a optimal solution involves evaluating by comparison a large number of possible solution variables. Methods like Simulated Annealing, MaxWalkSat and Differential Evolution apply heuristic approach to problem solving, this speeds up the process of problem solving, but does not guarantee the optimal solution. Using "less than" operators on the solution of these algorithms can help us decide optimal solutions between candidates, candidate sets and candidates from different optimizers. We can use this approach in deciding and using algorithms which will suit a particular problem.
